# Heart_Disease_Risk_Prediction
This project predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning models trained on patient health data such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVM. The best-performing models achieved ~80â€“85% accuracy, with Random Forest and SVM showing strong predictive ability. Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates the power of ML in healthcare risk prediction and prevention.
